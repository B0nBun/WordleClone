# Wordle Clone

This is a copy of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) written with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Quickstart

All you really need to do is compile the `script.ts` file and open the `index.html` in your browser.

```
~ node install -g typescript
~ tsc script.ts
```
